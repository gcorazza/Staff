## What's all about this Project??

I build a magic wand which has a programmable 2m LED Strip from bottom to top and a gyroscope and acceleration sensor build in.
This project implements the logic for the LED and Sensors.

## Tools

I programmed two web based tool to bake curves to an array:
- #### cubicCurveToEvenList.html
  Interpolates points with spline functions
- #### svgToEvenList.html
  converts a svg curve, see bootyfull.svg as an example (convenient to edit in gimp)
